## Introduction
Salmonella enterica is a Gram negative, rod shaped, facultative anaerobic bacterium that belongs to the family Enterobacteriaceae (Jajere, 2019). Salmonella enterica is a major cause of foodborne illness and remains an important public health concern worldwide (Havelaar et al., 2015). According to the WHO global burden estimates, most of the overall foodborne disease burden comes from diarrheal illnesses, and Salmonella enterica accounts for a meaningful share of that burden across the world (Havelaar et al., 2015). In this assignment, I will use Oxford Nanopore R10 long read sequencing data to assemble a consensus genome for Salmonella enterica and then compare it to a reference genome from NCBI through alignment, variant calling, and visualization. The significance of this project is that assembling and comparing the genome provides a clear, practical way to understand how genome assembly quality and reference based analysis affect what we conclude about variation in a clinically important pathogen.
